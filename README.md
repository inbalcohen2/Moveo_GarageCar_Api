### About the project-
The project includes 2 parts when they simulate a garage management system.
The first part of the project:
is the management and implementation of a database of vehicles of different types, 
with each vehicle having unique characteristics and functionality according to its type.
Can be expanded in case we need to add new types of vehicles.
